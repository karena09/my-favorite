        <p> My favorite hobby is making jewerly, it's my favorite hobby because it's a way I can let my creativity flow and there's no limit to what I'm able to make. I've always liked collecting charms, small pieces of metal, and etc so making jewerly is a way I can put those objects to use (I have a container filled with charms that I've collected). The type of jewerly I like isn't easy to find in stores so I'm able to make it on my own for free. Jewerly is a type of art you can wear and not just hang it on a wall. But most importantly, it's fun and a time-passing activity.
